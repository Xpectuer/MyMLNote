## Why OVERFITTING?

### <font color="#B40404 ">Model</font>

When it comes to overfitting, we should really think about the **model** in use.

Once it get too much complexity, the problem of efficiency and overfitting arises.

### <font color="#B40404 ">Data set</font>

When you feed too **little** size of data set for **training** ,the problem arises.

### <font color="#B40404 ">Unvoidable Problem</font>

The problem of OVERFITTING is **unavoidable** because you will never know which size is proper to gain the equilibrim between **efficiency** and the 
***solution of overfitting***

However, what we can do is to relief the problem.Thus, we have these method to **improve** the situation.
